Motivation:
  The purpose of this project is analyzing the personal data from Ticket Restuaurant Card. By examining this data I aim to   gein depper insights of by spending habits. While analyzing it I will observe my eating behaviours, how my spending habits  change between summer and school period, identifying the food categories I spend most on and tracking how quickly my        balance depletes after each top-up.

The following tools will be used in this project:
  Python:
    Pandas: For data structring.
    Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualization.
    Numpy: For mathematical computations.
  Jupyter Notebook: For coding and analysis.
  Excel: For handling the raw data.

Data Source:
  The data was retrieved from Ticket Restaurant application and exported in Excel format.
  This Excel table shows the restaurant name, transaction name, transaction amount and remaining card balance. So that datas can be compared to each other.

Analysis:
  Expenditure Trends by Periods: Comparing the spending amount between summer and school periods. Visualizing this patterns with line and bar charts.
 After that finding which food category I spent most on with percantages. Then displaying them with pie charts and bar charts.
 In balance deplation analysis part I will check which month my balance runs out faster than others and compare the months. Displaying them with line charts.
 In daily spending analysis I will group the data with days and visualize them by using histogram. 
 Lastly, I will determine the restaurants with highest spending and ranked them with bar charts.

 Findings:
   I used this card more during school period than summer.
   Almost all the spendings can be seen in restaurants, followed by cafes.
   On average, by balance die out about two weeks after the top-up's.
   The card is used more on weekdays than on weekends.

Limitations:
  The analysis is based on personal data. So it can be generalized. Also it has some private data which will not shown here.(personal identifiers)

Future Work:
  Analysis time can be extended for long term comparasions.
  Some predictible model can be developed for future spendings.
  Adding some detailed cathegories might help for the better ideas.
